# Task to solve

Create 2 writers and 2 readers services with different
period of launching. Writers periodically change two
counters the sum of which always should be 100. The readers
show that counterâ€™s value. Prove that without synchronization the sum of two
counters is not always 100.

# Get started

### Clone the repo

```
git clone git@github.com:danielyandev/python-lock-test.git
```

### Install requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Prepare environment

Prepare .env file

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Prepare counter files

```
cp counter.txt.example counter1.txt
cp counter.txt.example counter2.txt
```

Set USE_FILE_LOCK variable in .env file one of these values:
{true, 1} to use file locking, otherwise operations with file
will be performed without locking

### Run the script

```
python main.py
```

# Results

Running script with and without locking,
we can see different results

### With locking

Using locks will result in having correct result: each
time the sum will be equal to 100, because files are locked
during write/read processes and no other process can access it.

### Without locking

If we don't use locks we face such cases when file was overwritten
by 2 processes simultaneously and the final result can't be predicted.

# Conclusion

Without synchronization the sum of two counters is not
always 100. To have predictable results in multithreading
applications, it is important to use file locking.
